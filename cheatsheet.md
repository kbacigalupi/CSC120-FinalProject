This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT
Commands that work:
help
take 'item' (pan, saw, sugar, flour, cinnamon, recipe, butter)
paddle to 'name of location'
portage
drop 'item' - drops an item but there is no point in using this because you must have 
make cinnamon rolls - can only do this once at the end in the correct location
exit - to stop loop
look - to tell you where you can go
have - tells what the user has
"open chest" before "take recipe"


If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.
Must pick up all items to make the cinnamon rolls
Must have the saw to be able to portage from one area to the other
Can only type in "make cinnamon rolls" once at the correct location AND have all of the items to win
Otherwise the game ends
