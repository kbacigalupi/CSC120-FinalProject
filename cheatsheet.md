This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT
Commands that work:
help -tells you 
take 'item' (pan, saw, sugar, flour, cinnamon, recipe, butter)
paddle to 'name of location'
portage
make cinnamon rolls - can only do this once at the end in the correct location
exit - to stop loop
look - to tell you where you can go 
have - tells what the user has
need - tells the user what they need to pick up to win
examine - tells the user what an item is for; can only be used when the user is at the same location as the item

Commands are not case sensitive (can type in lowercase or uppercase)


If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.
Must pick up all items to make the cinnamon rolls (butter, saw, cinnamon, flour, sugar, recipe, pan)
Must have the saw to be able to portage from one area to the other
Can only type in "make cinnamon rolls" once at the correct location AND have all of the items to win
Otherwise the game ends
You cannot move to every location from every other location-a map is attatched with the locations you can reach from each other location.
